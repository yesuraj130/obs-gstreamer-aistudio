GStreamer OBS Studio plugin
===

1. An OBS Studio source plugin to feed GStreamer launch pipelines into [OBS
Studio].

This plugin has interesting use cases but may be difficult to understand and is
clunky use if you are _not_ familiar with GStreamer.

2. An OBS Studio encoder plugin to use GStreamer encoder elements into [OBS Studio].

This may be interesting for people trying to run OBS Studio to different platforms like the RaspberryPi or NVIDIA Tegra.

3. An OBS Studio video filter plugin to use GStreamer pipelines as video filters in [OBS Studio].

This may be handy to quickly get some simple filters in but also complex pipelines are possible as long as no rate or dimension changes are done.

4. An OBS Studio audio filter plugin to use GStreamer pipelines as audio filters in [OBS Studio].

This may be handy to quickly get some simple filters in but also complex pipelines are possible as long as no rate or dimension changes are done.

Prebuilt
---

Experimental prebuilt 64-bit Windows plugin is available. You still require the
official [GStreamer run-time] (MinGW version) to be installed. Make sure the
run-time `bin` path is added to Windows's `PATH` environment.

Experimental prebuilt macOS plugin available. You still require the GStreamer
run-time installed via [Macports] (not Homebrew).

Experimental prebuilt Linux plugin is available. You still require the GStreamer
run-time installed via your Linux ditribution's package manager.

Linux plugins can be installed in locations that follow this scheme:
```
~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/<pluginname>/bin/64bit/<pluginname>.so
```

[OBS Studio]: https://obsproject.com/
[GStreamer run-time]: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/
[Macports]: https://www.macports.org/

Usage
---

The source plugin makes use of the GStreamer launch pipeline descriptions. Please
refer to the GStreamer documentation to understand what this means:

https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tools/gst-launch.html

This plugins provides two media sinks named `video` and `audio`. These are the
media sinks that hand over data to OBS Studio. So your pipeline should connect
to these sinks.

An example pipeline:

    videotestsrc is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate=30/1, width=960, height=540 ! video. audiotestsrc wave=ticks is-live=true ! audio/x-raw, channels=2, rate=44100 ! audio.

RTMP example:

    uridecodebin uri=rtmp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:bigbuckbunny_1500.mp4 name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

RTSP example:

    uridecodebin uri=rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

RTSP example with h265 decoding via Nvidia GPU and MP2L2 audio extraction:

    rtspsrc location=rtspt://admin:*****@*****.ath.cx:555/Streaming/Channels/101 name=bin ! queue ! rtph265depay ! nvdec ! gldownload ! watchdog timeout=10000 ! video. bin. ! queue ! rtpmpadepay ! mpegaudioparse ! mpg123audiodec ! audio.

RTSP H264 TS source with NTP sync and Nvidia GPU decoder example:

    rtspsrc location=rtsp://h264-encoder.local/main1 rfc7273-sync=true buffer-mode=4 latency=40 ! rtmp2tdepay ! tsdemux latency=0 ! h264parse ! nvh264dec ! video.

HLS example:

    uridecodebin uri=http://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net:1935/vod/mp4:sample.mp4/playlist.m3u8 name=bin ! queue ! video. bin. ! queue ! audio.

Linux webcam example:

    v4l2src ! decodebin ! video.

Linux webcam example with watchdog (automatically restarts the pipeline if the webcam stream crashes for some reason):

    v4l2src ! watchdog ! decodebin ! video.



If you don't understand what is happening in these lines please check the
GStreamer documentation as mentioned above!


Build
---

```shell
$ meson --buildtype=release build
$ ninja -C build

# optional for installing the plugin
$ sudo ninja -C build install
```

By default it will install in the plugin directory of the user's home directory. (Linux only!)

For system wide installs or other platforms you will need to pass additional options for the install location.

E.g.
```shell
meson setup build --buildtype=release --prefix=/usr --libdir=lib/obs-plugins
```
will install at `/usr/lib/obs-plugins`.

## WebRTC (WHEP) Output

The GStreamer Output dock supports a built-in WebRTC (WHEP) server mode. The OBS
scene is encoded once (H.264) and fanned out to any number of browsers with
sub-second latency. No external signaling or media server is required.

### Usage

1. Open the **GStreamer Output** dock and add/edit an output.
2. Set **Output mode** to `WebRTC`.
3. Start the output, then open `http://<host>:8888/` in a browser.

Multiple viewers are supported; each browser gets its own `webrtcbin` branch
from a shared encode pipeline.

### Settings

- **WebRTC HTTP port** — port for the embedded HTTP/WHEP server (default `8888`).
- **WebRTC web root** — folder containing the viewer page (`index.html`,
  `style.css`, `app.js`). Leave empty to use
  `~/.local/share/obs-gstreamer/webrtc`, which is seeded automatically on first
  start. Edit the files there to customize the player page; changes apply on
  browser refresh without rebuilding.
- **WebRTC STUN server** — optional (`stun://stun.l.google.com:19302`). Leave
  empty for LAN-only viewing (host candidates only).
- **Start output automatically when OBS launches** — auto-starts this output
  when OBS starts.

The canonical copies of the default viewer assets live in
[`.webrtc-webroot/`](.webrtc-webroot/) in this repository.

### WHEP endpoint

Browsers POST an SDP offer to `/whep` and receive a non-trickle SDP answer
(`201 Created` + `Location: /whep/<id>`). Sessions end via `DELETE /whep/<id>`
or when the peer disconnects. Static files are served from the configured web
root.

### Dependencies

- Linux: `gstreamer1.0-nice` (ICE/libnice), `libsoup-3.0-dev`, plus the usual
  GStreamer development packages.
- Windows (MinGW/MSVC): the GStreamer installers bundle libsoup3 and webrtcbin;
  ensure these runtime DLLs ship next to the plugin: `libsoup-3-0-0.dll`,
  `libgstwebrtc-1.0-0.dll`, `libgstsdp-1.0-0.dll`, and the glib-networking TLS
  backend for `souphttpsrc`.
- macOS (MacPorts): `libsoup3`.

### Notes

- Video only (no audio/Opus yet).
- Latency is typically well under one second on LAN.
- If the port is already in use, output start fails with a clear error in the
  OBS log.


## Codespace Development Environment

This project includes a reproducible GitHub Codespaces development environment.

### Build

After creating or reopening a Codespace:

    meson setup build --buildtype=release
    ninja -C build
    ninja -C build install

### OBS GUI via noVNC

Start the graphical XFCE desktop, TigerVNC, and noVNC:

    .devcontainer/start-vnc.sh

Then open forwarded port 6080 in the GitHub Codespaces Ports panel and open `/vnc.html`.

The VNC password is provided through the `VNC_PASSWORD` Codespaces secret and is never stored in this repository.

### OBS GUI via noVNC and RealVNC via Tailscale

After creating or rebuilding the Codespace, authenticate Tailscale:

    sudo tailscale up

### Restart VNC if necessary:

    vncserver -kill :1 2>/dev/null || true
    rm -f /tmp/.X1-lock /tmp/.X11-unix/X1
    .devcontainer/start-vnc.sh

### Restart VNC if necessary:

    ss -ltn | grep 5901

### Fresh Codespace

Development dependencies are installed automatically by:

    .devcontainer/setup.sh

Container configuration:

    .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

The plugin is installed to:

    ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-gstreamer/bin/64bit/obs-gstreamer.so
